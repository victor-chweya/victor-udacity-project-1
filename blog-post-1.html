              <h1>How I got into UI/UX Design and Front End Development</h1>
              <p>It was in 2010 after working two years at Freight company straight out of university that I quit my job to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I couldn't see myself working a desk job from 8 to 5 doing repetitive tasks.</p>
              <p>I've always been fascinated by design since I was young, I remember entering design competitions in school designing school emblems and designing t shirts for my high-school class and rugby team, for me this was just a hobby something I liked to do for fun.</p>
              <p>After clearing high school (2003) I went straight to university where I studied Finance. I wanted to do Computer science but I was pushed into doing Finance as it was considered a lucrative course back then this is in Kenya. While studying finance, I was lucky to be introduced into programming by taking a short course in Java (2005) taught by MIT students. It was more of an intro course but it opened my mind into this new field that i had no idea about. I tried learning as much Java as i could but I was more interested in design so programming took a back seat.</p>
              <p>I found myself designing logos, posters, brochures for family and friends and assembling computers as a side hustle while in university. There wasn't much design resources and access to the Internet, computers and design software was expensive back then. While doing small design favours for guys I got interested in web design and started learning about HTML and CSS, you can check out my first site <a href="https://avicdesign.com">avicdesign.com</a> This was around 2006 and my dream was to start a design company that will help put businesses on-line.</p>

              <p>I played around with designing websites and got into business of developing sites for clients mostly using Joomla CMS templates around 2007. By this point I had taught myself basic HTML/CSS, PHP , JS and MYSQL, I wasn't doing a lot of designing from scratch then because of existing templates. I graduated in 2008 and I was lucky to get a job that same year. With the new job, it was so demanding leaving me with no time to pursue my interest in design so I stopped designing, two years later I quit because I honestly felt that its not what I wanted to do the rest of my life.</p>
